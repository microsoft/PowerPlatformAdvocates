# Mixed Reality Workshop

Welcome to the Mixed Reality workshop. In this workshop, you will learn all about the Mixed Reality (MR) controls in Power Apps. At the end of this workshop, you will have built your first app with MR controls. The workshop consists of multiple labs and some overview presentations to set the scenes.

## Agenda

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 0 - Setup your environment

This lab is all about setting up your environment. This is what you need to get started. Make sure to do this before starting the workshop.

🚀 [Lab 0 - Setup your environment](Lab%2000%20-%20Setup%20your%20environment/README.md)

### 📺 Introduction to the Power Platform

During this section, an introduction to the Power Platform will be given. You get answers to questions like:

- What is the Power Platform?
- What does it consist of?
- What's in it for me?
- How do I learn more about it?

### 📺 Introduction to Power Apps & Canvas Apps

In this section, you will get an overview of what Power Apps is, what types of Power Apps there are, and we will elaborate on which controls you can use. The Creator Kit components and Mixed Reality (MR) controls will get the spotlight, because we are going to use those later in the labs!

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 1 - Creator Kit and Canvas Apps

It's time to get to work! In this lab, you will learn about components. The Creator Kit offers a set of components that are ready for reuse and that's what we are going to use in this lab.

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 2 - View in MR in Canvas Apps

In this lab, you'll create two galleries that'll provide a list of all objects available for view in mixed reality. Once the galleries are configured, you'll create a information screen that'll provide details about the object in addition to functionality to view the model in your physical environment.

### 📺 Introduction to Custom Connectors

In lab 3, you will experience how to build your first Custom Connector. Before that, it's good to learn more about the Custom Connectors.

- What is a Custom Connector?
- Where can I use it for?
- In which products can I use a Custom Connector?

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 3 - Create your first Custom Connector

It's time to get to work! Go build your first Custom Connector. In this lab, you will build a Custom Connector for the [Smithsonian 3D API](https://3d.si.edu/). This free API gives you the possibility to search for content from the Smithsonian Institution. This can be various types of media, like for instance 3D Images.

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 4 - View in 3D in Canvas Apps

In this lab, we will use the Custom Connector from Lab 1, and use that in our very own Canvas App. We will use the Mixed Reality (MR) controls to show the content from the [Smithsonian Institution Open Access API](https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/) in a nice way. At the end of this lab, you will have created a Canvas App that uses a Custom Connector and 3D Images.
