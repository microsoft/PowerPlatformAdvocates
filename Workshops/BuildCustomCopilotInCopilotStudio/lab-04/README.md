## What are connectors?

Connectors from Microsoft Power Automate are a proxy or "wrapper" around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps. Connectors let you connect your accounts and use a set of prebuilt actions and triggers to build your apps and workflows.

With connectors you can access various services (both within the Microsoft ecosystem and outside it) to perform a wide array of tasks automatically.

There are many connectors available, ranging from connections between and to Microsoft services like Office 365, SharePoint, and Dynamics 365, all the way to connections to third-party services like Twitter, Google services, Salesforce, and more. 

These connectors are categorized as:
- **Standard Connectors**  which are available in most Power Automate plans
- **Premium Connectors** which require specific Power Automate plans
- **Custom Connectors** which let you connect to any publicly available API for services not covered by existing connectors

## How do connectors work with Microsoft Copilot Studio?

Microsoft Power Automate connectors help extend the functionality of Microsoft Copilot Studio, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks by connecting with various external services and applications. This integration empowers agent makers to create more dynamic, responsive, and useful agents, tailored to specific business needs and processes.

You can use connectors that already exist in your Power Apps environment or create a Power Automate cloud flow from the Microsoft Copilot Studio authoring canvas through the **Call an action** node.

In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:

## 4.1 Create a Power Automate cloud flow for your agent

In this part of the lab you’ll learn how to add additional logic and automation. 

A question will be added to the authoring canvas to ask the user if they want to send the questions generated for a quiz to a channel in Microsoft Teams for members of the channel to review.

- Should the user select _Yes_, a Power Automate cloud flow will be executed to send a Microsoft Teams message to your manager where the message content includes the prompt response from the plugin action.

- Should the user select _No_, a new node will be added to redirect to the *End of Conversation* node.

Let's begin with creating a Power Automate cloud flow to the existing topic created in [Lab 03 - Create a Prompt action for a Topic for generative answers](../lab-03/README.md)
