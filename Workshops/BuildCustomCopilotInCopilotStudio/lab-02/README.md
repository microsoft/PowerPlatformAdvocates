# Lab 02 - Build an agent with Microsoft Copilot Studio

Copilot Studio empowers teams to quickly and easily create powerful agents using a guided, no-code graphical experience without needing data scientists or developers.

There are several ways to create an agent
* Start with a template
* Describe your agent to create it using natural language

Each method allows you to connect your data and knowledge sources to enable your agent to access information and complete tasks.

In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:
* [2.1 Available templates to create an agent copilot](#21-available-templates-to-create-an-agent)
* [2.2 Use natural language to create an agent](#22-use-natural-language-to-create-an-agent)
* [2.3 Adding an internal knowledge source using a SharePoint site](#223-adding-an-internal-source-using-a-sharepoint-site)

## 2.1 Available templates to create an agent

In this part of the lab, you will learn of the several templates available to quickly get started in creating your own agent.
In the Home landing page of Microsoft Copilot Studio, you’ll see three areas
* Describe your copilot to create it – use natural language to build your agent
* Templates – these are a preview feature and helps you get started in creating your agent
* Learning resources – multiple resources for further learning

    - **Schema Name** – by default this will be the name of your agent. This is the unique name which can be used to embed or connect your agent to other applications or services.
    - **Classic copilot** – there’s also an option to create a classic agent which is not covered in this lab.
    
    ![Advanced settings](assets/2.1_09_AdvancedSettings.jpg)

1.  Select **Cancel** to exit Advanced Settings.

1.  Select **Create** to create your Weather agent.

    ![Create Weather agent](assets/2.1_10_CreateWeatherAgent.jpg)

1.  Copilot Studio will be in the process of setting up the Weather agent and when complete, the Weather agent will be displayed in the center of Copilot Studio, followed by the testing pane on the right hand side.

    ![Weather agent](assets/2.1_11_WeatherAgentCreated.jpg)

1.  Scroll down and you’ll see that the Topics and Actions are already configured from the template, enabling you to quickly create a Weather agent.

    ![Agent Topics and Actions](assets/2.1_12_TopicsActions.jpg)

1.  You can now test the Weather agent using the right hand side pane. Select the **What can I ask?** question to see a list of suggested questions to ask the Weather agent.

    ![Suggested questions](assets/2.1_13_TestAgent.jpg)
    
1.  A list of questions will appear. Select **What is the current weather?**

    ![Weather agent created](assets/2.1_14_SelectQuestion.jpg)

1.  Enter a city for example,

    ```
    Seattle
    ```

    ![Eneter city](assets/2.1_15_EnterCity.jpg)

1.  The Weather agent will respond with a summary of the current weather for the city entered.

    ![Weather agent response](assets/2.1_16_Response.jpg)

🎓 You’ve created an agent using a template. Let’s next learn how to use natural language to build an agent from scratch.

## 2.2 Use natural language to create an agent

You can now use a conversation first approach to create an agent where natural language is used to describe the agent that you’d like to create.

1.  Select Home on the left hand side menu and in the Describe your copilot to create it field, describe in natural language what your agent should do. For example,

    ```
    I want you to be a question and answering assistant that can answer common questions from users using the content of a website and a SharePoint site
    ```

    ![City](assets/2.2_01_DescribeToCreate.jpg)

1. Microsoft Copilot Studio then proceeds to use AI to ask you several questions to define the agent you want to build. For example the first question may be based on how your agent will assist users.

    ![City](assets/2.2_02_DescribeTypeOfAssistance.jpg)

    You can either select _What should I say?_ which will provide guidance, or you can enter and describe what you’d like your agent to do. The following is an example,

    ```
    help answer common product and support questions using the content of a website, and help answer HR questions from a SharePoint site
    ```


1. The second question may be based on the tone of the agent. Again, a list of suggestions can be provided by selecting _What should I say?_

    ![Further guidance](assets/2.2_03_Further%20guidance.jpg)

1.  A list of suggestions will appear for guidance. Enter a tone, for example,

    ```
    Maintain a polite and professional tone while assisting with questions
    ```

    ![Tone](assets/2.2_04_Tone.jpg)

1.  Next question will be based on what external knowledge source the Copilot can refer to answer questions asked by users. A guide can be provided by selecting _Any tips?_

    ![Further guidance](assets/2.2_05_PubliclyAccessibleWebsitesTips.jpg)

1.  Guidance will appear on adding websites for your agent. Next enter a public facing website URL address. For example, enter the following,

    ```
    www.microsoft.com
    ```

    ![Further guidance](assets/2.2_06_TipsForWebsites.jpg)

1. You'll be asked whether you'd like to add more websites. Enter the following,

    ```
    No
    ```
    ![Add no further websites](assets/2.2_07_AddNoFurtherWebsites.jpg)

1.  The final question will be based on what topics or tasks the Copilot should not help with. For example, enter the following,

    ```
    If asked religion or politics, politely decline to discuss and offer assistance with other inquiries.
    ```

    ![Topics to dismiss](assets/2.2_08_TopicsTasksToDismiss.jpg)

1.  There are no further questions to answer but you can enter more details to make adjustments. 

    Notice how on the right hand side pane 
    - your agent has automatically been given a name
    - all your requirements for the agent you want to create are listed, this was based on the natural language entered to answer the questions asked by AI in creating an agent for you

    ![Done building agent](assets/2.2_09_DoneWithInstructions.jpg)

1.  Before creating you Copilot, there’s also the options of

    - **Skip to configure** – where you exit from this conversation first approach and create a custom copilot by not answering questions
    - Select the ellipsis for additional options  (**. . .**) 
        - **Restart copilot creation** – clears all answers in response to the question asked and starts at the beginning
        - **Edit advanced settings** – update the solution and schema name as previously covered in 2.1 Available templates to create a custom Copilot
        - **Cancel copilot creation** – cancels creating the copilot

    ![Additional settings](assets/2.2_10_AdditionalSettings.jpg)

1.  Select **Create** to create your agent.

    ![Create agent](assets/2.2_11_CreateAgent.jpg)

1. Copilot Studio will be in the process of setting up your agent.

    ![Create copilot](assets/2.2_12_SettingUp.jpg)

1.  When the setup is completed, the agent will be displayed in the center of Copilot Studio, followed by the testing pane on the right hand side. You'll see the **Name**, **Description** and **Instructions** used for your agent.

    ![Agent created](assets/2.2_13_AgentCreated.jpg)

1.  If you scroll down, you’ll see the knowledge source with the public website already configured. You can now test your agent by entering the following question,

    ```
    What is Copilot Studio?
    ```
    ![Ask a question](assets/2.2_14_TestAgent_Q1.jpg)

1. The agent uses the external link previously provided, _www.microsoft.com_, to return an answer in plain natural language. Notice that there are references with a hyperlink to where the information is sourced from so that you can validate it. You can also provide feedback by selecting the thumbs down or thumbs up icons.

    Try asking another question,
    
    ```
    What is the latest Xbox model?
    ```

    ![Ask another question](assets/2.2_15_TestAgent_Q2.jpg)

    The agent will respond again using information from the external link, _www.microsoft.com_. 
    
    ![Response to question](assets/2.2_16_TestAgent_Q2Response.jpg)

    This is useful because it allows you to build agents using existing information rather than creating specific topics to cater for user requests.
    
🎓 You've created an agent using natural language and can answer questions based on the website provided. Let's learn how to add an internal resource.

## 2.3 Adding an internal source using a SharePoint site

Knowledge in Microsoft Copilot Studio allows you to add enterprise data from Power Platform and external systems, to enable your agents in providing relevant information and insights to your end users. In addition, knowledge can be incorporated with [generative answers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/knowledge-copilot-studio#add-and-manage-knowledge-for-generative-answers) in agents. Published agents that contain knowledge use the configured knowledge sources to ground the published agent.

Next, you'll learn how to add an internal data source, SharePoint, for generative answers.

1. In the **Overview** tab of your agent, scroll down to the **Knowledge** section and select **+Add Knowledge**.

    ![Add knowledge](assets/2.3_01_AddKnowledge.jpg)

1. A list of knowledge sources will appear. Select SharePoint.

    ![Add SharePoint internal source](assets/2.3_02_AddSharePointDataSource.jpg)

1.  Paste the SharePoint site URL from the SharePoint site you created earlier in the sources field and select Add.

    ![SharePoint URL](assets/2.3_03_SharePointSiteURL.jpg)

> [!TIP]  
> To recopy the SharePoint site URL, head to the [⏪ previous lab](../lab-01/README.md/#relaunch-sharepoint-site) to copy the SharePoint site URL and return to this lab to proceed.

4.  The SharePoint site is added as a Knowledge Source. Please note that the SharePoint Site will only be available to authenticated end-users, [learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/nlu-generative-answers-sharepoint-onedrive). Select Add.

    ![Add data source](assets/2.3_04_AddDataSource.jpg)

1.  The SharePoint site has now been added as a knowledge source for the Copilot.

    ![Data source URL](assets/2.3_05_KnowledgeSources.jpg)

1.  Before we can test, the generative AI feature needs to be enabled. Select Settings on the top right of the Copilot.

    ![Settings](assets/2.3_06_Settings.jpg)

1.  Select Generative AI in the Settings menu on the left hand side pane, followed by selecting the Generative (preview) setting and select Save.

    ![Settings](assets/2.3_07_GenerativeSetting.jpg)
    
1.  Select the X icon on the right hand side to return to the Copilot.  We can now test copilot to confirm SharePoint is now a data source for generative answers. Select the refresh icon and enter the question,

    ```
    What happens if I'm sick and cannot work?
    ```

1.  This time Copilot uses the internal link [https://m365x73059307.sharepoint.com/](https://m365x73059307.sharepoint.com) to return the answer it found in a document in plain natural language. References are provided once again with a hyperlink to where the information is sourced from so that you can validate it.

    ![Time off question](assets/2.3_08_Question1.jpg)

1.  Try entering another question, 

    ```
    What holidays do Contoso employees have off?
    ```

![Holidays question](assets/2.3_09_Question2.jpg)

1.  You’ll see another response from Copilot that uses the SharePoint data source to answer the question entered in plain natural language.

    ![Holidays for Contoso employees](assets/2.3_10_AnswerToQuestion2.jpg)

## Next lab
