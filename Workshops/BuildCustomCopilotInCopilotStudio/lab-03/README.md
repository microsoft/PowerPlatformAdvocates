# Lab 03 - Create a Prompt action using a Power Platform connector for generative responses

Plugins can be used to extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 or used within a custom copilot as a plugin action. You can create multiple types of actions in Microsoft Copilot Studio:
- **Prebuilt connector action**, which use Power Platform connectors to access data from other systems, such as popular enterprise products like Salesforce, Zendesk, MailChimp, and GitHub.
- **Custom connector action**, where a connector can be built to access data from public or private APIs.
- **Power Automate cloud flow**, which use Power Automate flows to perform actions, and retrieve and work with data.
- **AI Builder prompts**, which use AI Builder and natural language understanding to target the specific scenarios and workflows within your business.
- **•	Bot Framework skill**, which use the skill manifest that outlines the actions the skill can perform, including its input and output parameters, the skill's endpoints, and dispatch models for the skill.

In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:

## 3.1 Create a prompt plugin for generative responses

In this part of the lab we’ll be creating a **prompt plugin** which is the **Generate content or extract insights** action from the AI Builder connector. The experience to create prompt plugins in Copilot Studio is the same as in Power Apps. Any plugins you create in either Copilot Studio or Power Apps go to the plugin registry and populate in both apps.

1.	Select **Library** in the left-hand side menu, select **Add an ttem** and select **Copilot for Microsoft 365**.

    - **Name** of the prompt on the top left
    - **Prompt settings** on the right hand side which contains
        - **Input** where the inputs parameters for the prompt can be added or deleted.
        - **Data used (preview**) where you can use your own data from Dataverse tables in a prompt.
        - **Output** where you define the response to be returned as text or JSON (preview).
        - **Settings** where you define the GPT model to be used for generating response and the temperature slider allows you to select the temperature of to control the randomness of the output generated by the AI model, learn more.
    - **Prompt** on the top left hand side which is where you can enter your prompt. You can also start by using the suggested prompts, and test the prompt.
    - **Prompt response** on the bottom left hand side which displays the response generated based on the prompt.
