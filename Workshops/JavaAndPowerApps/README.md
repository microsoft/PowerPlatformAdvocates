## Agenda

### Lab 0 - Setup your environment
This lab is all about setting up your environment. This is what you need to get started. Make sure to do this before starting the workshop.

### Lab 1 - Getting the Java API up and running in Azure
This lab will help you deploy the Java API to Azure using the Azure Developer CLI.

### Lab 2 - Adding data with the ToDo API
Now that you've got our API up and running in Azure, let's add some data so it's there, ready and waiting, for us to play with in Power Apps.

### Lab 3 - Creating a Custom Connector
This lab will help you enable your Power App to interact with the API in the previous lab, by creating a Custom Connector.

### Lab 4 - Testing a Custom Connector
With the Custom Connector created, this lab will take you through the necessary steps to test it and to make sure that it's working appropriately.

### Lab 5 - Creating a Power Apps Canvas App
In this lab, you'll be creating the UI for a ToDo List Canvas App which will then be backed by the Custom Connector you created in Lab 3.

### Lab 6 - Adding data to a Power Apps Canvas App
In this lab, you'll be finally connecting the Custom Connector you created in the previous labs to the Canvas App you've just built.
