# Lab 1 - Laying the Foundation: Azure OpenAI Service

## Background

Dive into the world of Azure OpenAI Service. We introduce the service, describe the models, and guide you through creating deployments. Setting the stage for seamless AI integration.

## Definitions

### What is Azure OpenAI Service?

Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Embeddings model series. In addition, the new GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo model series have now reached general availability. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, image understanding, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

### Create model deployments in Azure OpenAI Studio

1. Open up your **PodcastCopilot** resource group in the Azure portal.

1. Select the **podcastcopilotsc-{your initials}** resource.

1. On the top menu, click on **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio**.

    ![Go to Azure OpenAI Studio](assets/go-to-azure-openai-studio.png)

    > NOTE:
    >
    > In Azure OpenAI Studio, you may see the following banners alerting you to the studio's new look. Select **Explore the new experience** to continue in the updated studio.
    >
    > ![Azure OpenAI Studio New Look Banner 1](assets/azure-openai-studio-new-look-banner-1.png)

    >
    > If you don't see these banners, then you're likely already in the updated studio.

1. In the Azure OpenAI Studio, click on **Deployments** on the left menu.

1. Select **+ Deploy model** > **Deploy base model**.

1. In the **Select a model** window, search for and select `gpt-4`.

    Select **Confirm**.
